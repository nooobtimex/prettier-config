# `next build` spawns Node worker processes (page/route compilation, static
# generation), so the build stage needs a `node` binary even though Bun drives it.
# Debian's own `nodejs` package is Node 20 — two majors behind the runner — so lift
# the real Node 26 binary out of the official image instead. Both this base and
# node:26-slim are Debian trixie, so the glibc matches; `libatomic1` is the only
# shared library the Bun slim image is missing. Keep the two Debian releases in step
# if either tag moves.

#   + NODE_OPTIONS only ..... 92.8 MiB
#   + MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2 .... 81.8 MiB
# MALLOC_ARENA_MAX does most of the work: the growth here is native allocator
# retention, not V8 old space, and glibc's default of 8×cores worth of per-thread
# arenas never hands those pages back. Capping the heap is a distant second — at
# 64 MB it changed almost nothing and still didn't OOM — so treat --max-old-space
# as a runaway guard rather than an optimization, and raise it first if the deploy
# ever crash-loops.
